## Project Details

### UNICEF
UNICEF has been innovating for children for 70 years. The work in this area is led by an Innovation Unit in New York that supports the organization – and particularly UNICEF’s 135 country offices – in finding solutions for the world’s most vulnerable children.

### Challenge:
UNICEF needs your help in finding a way to deliver vaccines to developing countries. Your challenge will be to create a new chat integration with the RapidPro platform, a robust, open source communications engine supported by UNICEF.
